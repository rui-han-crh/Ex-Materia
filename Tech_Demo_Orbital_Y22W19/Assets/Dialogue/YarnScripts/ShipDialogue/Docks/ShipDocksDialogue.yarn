Evelyn: Just shut up. We got the core, move out of the way. We're installing it.

Evelyn brushes past Lucien and heads across the bridge, towards an elephantine vehicle up ahead.

    <<load Speaker Lucien Neutral>>
    Lucien: It's normal. She's just insufferable.

    Lucien: You know, thinking just because she had a hard life, she has to get back at the world doing whatever she wants.

    Lucien: She gets work done, so I have don't really have an issue, but she's just a straight b-

Docks: Before you stands a grim man, his body encased tightly by a black vest, his eyes sunken beneath the weight of the past.

Docks: Yet, from within him, he summons a gentler facade - the extension of friendship.

<<load Speaker Lucien Neutral>>
Lucien: My name is Lucien.

<<load Speaker Emmanuel Neutral>>
Emmanuel: I'm Emmanuel.

<<load Speaker Lucien Neutral>>
Lucien: Good to meet you Emmanuel. I'm glad we got off on the right foot here.

Lucien: Did you have a role assigned here?

<<load Speaker Emmanuel Neutral>>
Emmanuel: No, Estelle never gave me one. I'm just here to tag along.

<<clear Speaker>>
Docks: Luciens raises both his hands in the air.

<<load Speaker Lucien Neutral>>
Lucien: Alright alright, naturally. Usually the newcomers don't start off with assigned roles, they usually just help out wherever they can.

<<clear Speaker>>
Docks: Still, his tone betrays a slight hint of disappointment.

Lucien: We're at the docks.

Lucien: This is where West Callesmere's ships are docked.

Lucien: No actually... It's just one of the place. We have other docks around the region, just in case the East evicerate this one.

Lucien: Most of us here are those preparing for our next mission. This dock itself is managed by Estelle.

Lucien: This vehicle behind me is our ship. This is the Progeny, we use this ship to conduct our missions.

Lucien: Evelyn is the captain here.

Lucien: It's East of this location, almost at the dividing line between the East and the West.

Lucien: The previous mission had developed a pretty strong salient point at the border, but they weren't able to make it through.

Lucien: Then they caught us offguard and cut off a major artery that we use to supply resources over.

Lucien: We noticed our people kept disappearing and those in the frontlines weren't receiving our resources.

Lucien: So that's when we discovered that the East developed a blockade to restrict supply movement. They want to suffocate us from our food and ammunitions.

Lucien: I was below repairing our autotargetting systems, but it seems like their calibrations are not working.

Lucien: I could use some help. Come find me again when you're ready.
