Olivia: Now, we'll move onto shooting

Lucien: There are also other covers in the game 
Lucien: Covers are a <B> Hide </B> mechanic 
Lucien: Firstly, let's talk about half-covers.
Lucien: If the straight line of sight between you and the enemy passes through a Half-Cover
Lucien: It reduces the chance of you being hit by an enemy
Lucien: So try to position yourself advantageously in between these areas!


<<load Speaker Lucien Happy>>

Lucien: Got everything so far?
-> Yes! 
    Lucien: Alrighties 
-> Not really...
    Lucien: It'll become clearer with the upcoming playthrough

Lucien: Similarly, Full covers work the same way but with an added twist 
Lucien: You are not able to shoot them, and neither can they shoot you! 
Lucien: So they essentially act like walls!
Lucien: As an added fun fact, your allies <B> can act as human meat shields for you! </B>
Lucien: Which basically means they can block enemy shots, so they act as a de-facto full cover.
Lucien: Next up is overwatch! 
Lucien: It's that little button with the sword going through.. 
Lucien: If enemies pass through your line of sight while you're in overwatch 
Lucien: They get hit! Your ATK and DEF are also doubled
Lucien: Okay then..
Lucien: Let's try it out for real!
Lucien: <B> Use the Overwatch Ability to Continue! </B>
Lucien: If the enemies are caught in the crossfire, you'll do some huge damage

Evelyn: Good! 
Evelyn: You're almost there 
Evelyn: The last part of the game are the last 2 abilities 
Evelyn: In this world, each character has their own unique basic ability, and ultimate!
Evelyn: The main difference is the <B> cost in terms of time </B>
Evelyn: But for the most part, abilities are <B> generally stat boosters </B>
Evelyn: Now go forth and use a stat ability!
