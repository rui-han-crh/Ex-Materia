Emmanuel: How do I know you're not lying 

<<clear Speaker>>
Mystery Man: Well...
Mystery Man: I don't have an answer for you 
Mystery Man: You're gonna have to trust me 

Engineer: I'm an Engineer by trade originally 
Engineer: In fact, I'm a maintenance Engineer


<<load Speaker Emmanuel Angry>>
Emmanuel: How's that of any use to me?

<<clear Speaker>>
Engineer: I worked on the maintenance of PAM
Engineer: I don't know what your cause is, or where you're from 
Engineer: But I can provide assistance in any way possible 

<<load Speaker Emmanuel Neutral>>
Emmanuel: Hm
Emmanuel: Continue?


<<clear Speaker>>
Engineer: There's a more pressing issue ahead 
Engineer: Ever since the East captured me, I've been relegated to a chef for the men here 
Engineer: I assume you've made quick work of them 
Engineer: But there's a secret weapon up their sleeve
Engineer: Somehow the East got hold of a sister system of PAM
-> A sister what now?
Engineer: I can explain 
Engineer: But they tweaked it slightly 
Engineer: Instead of using it to make predictions 
Engineer: They used another function of PAM
Engineer: The Government realised long ago that they could protect themselves with more than just human soldiers
Engineer: They had the technology and materials to artifically create a super soldier.
Engineer: Under the sugestion of PAM, some engineers embarked on a secret task to produce an AI-Assisted Super Soldier
Engineer: My colleagues were working on it back in my old lab
Engineer: This was long since scraped, but the East got hold of the body of one of these Super Soldiers and a sister System
Engineer: After reanimating the soldier, the East assigned him to this Blockade 
Engineer: Obviously it's not working perfectly, but he still packs a punch

<<load Speaker Emmanuel Neutral>>
Emmanuel: So why should I give a shit 
Emmanuel: That's your problem 

<<clear Speaker>>
Engineer: Ah
Engineer: But if you can dismantle this soldier
Engineer: Somewhere hidden in it's hunk of metal, it's biometrics have access to special rooms in the lab
Engineer: The soldier is supposedly able to repair itself, but it never got that far 
Engineer: However, I've personally seen tests where it's successfully navigated and entered certain restricted areas
Engineer: Basically, if you destroy the Soldier
Engineer: I'll have complete access to my old lab 
Engineer: And if you have any questions or issues with PAM
Engineer: I can definitely help 

-> How?

Engineer: I will explain in due time 
Engineer: But you simply have to trust me on this
