Lucien: Alright listen up
Lucien: Welcome to the border of East Cajovia
Lucien: I gathered some intel straight from the frontline 
Lucien: They're unable to advance cause of this settlement right here 
Lucien: These bastards are cutting off our supplies
Lucien: It's our job to get rid of these cunts 

<<load Speaker Evelyn Neutral>>
Evelyn: The actual Blockade is further down South, but there could be supplies here we could use to gear up 
Evelyn: Emmanuel, I need you to investigate that farmhouse over there
Evelyn: Search for supplies, any clues regarding their camp's layout 
Evelyn: We need to know where we might be able to infiltrate their defences...
Evelyn: We'll fuck them up where they least expect it
Evelyn: Tenatively, we strike at night

Bench: As the winter's wrath worsens, a once heavily used bench sits in the desolate snow 
Bench: A very long time ago, this area used to be place of gathering 
Bench: Children from the East and West would congregate here to play, while weary mothers would rest their feet on this very bench
Bench: Alas, those days are long gone

Tent: Everyone needs a Tent
Tent: A Tent can be a good source of <B> Cover </B>
Tent: Whether it's cover from the snow 
Tent: Or a half-cover from enemy fire 
Tent: Tents are indeed a wonderful invention
Tent: Although it might not be very viable to sleep inside one for the night
Tent: Frostbites' a bitch

Lucien: Looks like the farm owners once owned a small lake
Lucien: In fact, there seems to be many small lakes around this place

<<load Speaker Emmanuel Neutral>>
Emmanuel: Unsurprising, the border is native to many marine species 


<<load Speaker Lucien Neutral>>
Lucien: You should be careful <B> not to step in any frozen puddles of water </B>
Lucien: This is just heresay but...
Lucien: Some men from the 4th division over at the Frontlines fell into a frozen lake
Lucien: They died a cold and frigid death 
Lucien: You would be wise to avoid frozen areas
